# Promptopia Tutorial
  ![License:MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg) 

  ## Description
  
  I needed to learn and practice with REACT using NextJS. Using a [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) tutorial, I documented my progress with github.
  
  Promptopia is a way to share prompts to be used with AI-generated software. Users can create and share "prompts" with other users. Users are logged in and authenticated using Google and the 'next-auth' package.
  
  Not only was this a great way to practice REACT, but it was great exposure NextJS, which is a widely used extension of REACT. It allows the implementation of both frontend and backend elements, using the file system structure for routing, which is extremely convinient.
  
  This is purely a demonstration and documentation of learning NextJS through a walkthrough tutorial. The link to the tutorial is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5gMKuwSYk&t=7728s).
